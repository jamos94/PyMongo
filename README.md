# PyMongo

**This source code communicates with MongoDB (a NoSQL database) to Create, Read, Update, and Delete (CRUD) data.**

The purpose of this project is to apply database systems concepts and principles in development 
    - This specifically caters to creating a database that can interface with client-side code

The AnimalShelter.py file uses PyMongo to communicate with the database selected to as stated above; create, read, update, and delete.
    - The database created is for a animal shelter wanting to help rescue animals by training them. 
    - A main requirements of this database:
        - Must be able to interact with existing data from the shelter to identify and categorize dogs
        - Will be opensource and accessable on GitHub for accessability and adaptability for other organizations
        - Uses MongoDB for client/server interactive database
    - This project will be full-stack by the completion of the second sprint. This is the progress from sprint 1. 

How it works: 


**(Ensure MongoDB and Python are installed on the device which you are using the database on. )**
    A demonstration of how it works (its functional operations)
    An identification of the tools used and a rationale for why those tools were chosen
    An explanation of how to reproduce the project
